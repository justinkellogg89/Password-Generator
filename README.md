# Password-Generator

## This repo contains four files. An index.html, a style.css, a script.js, and a readme.md. The HTML and CSS file were pre-written code provided to me. The javascript file was written to enable the functionality of the password generator. When generate password is clicked, the user inputs some parameters, and the javascript assembles and provides the password requested.

## Installation

The only software requirements are a web browser.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Usage

The usage for this website is to provide the user with a randomly generated, unique password based on criteria entered by the user.

The criteria includes the length of the desired password from 8 to 128 characters. If a number is entered that is outside that range, it will clear the prompt and ask for the users input again.

Other criteria includes upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. The user is given a confirm browser window asking if they would like to use any of these criteria. Clicking OK (yes) gives a true value, and clicking CANCEL (no) gives a false value. True values will be used in the generated password, false values will not.

The user is then alerted with a browser window that confirms the criteria they entered. If the user accepts their parameters, they can click okay and receive their new password. If the user wants to change a parameter, they must click cancel and refresh the page.

## Project Status

This project is for all intents and purposes completed. There are a few features that could be added at a later date, but the purpose of the application is achieved.
